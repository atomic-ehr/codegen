# Task: Extend TypeSchema Processor for Profiles

## Priority
Medium

## Description
Extend the TypeSchema processing system to handle FHIR profiles:
- Add profile-aware schema transformation
- Handle profile extensions and constraints
- Support profile inheritance
- Add profile metadata tracking

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Extend schema transformer to detect and handle profiles
- [x] Add profile metadata to TypeSchema output
- [x] Implement profile inheritance handling
- [x] Add extension processing for profiles
- [x] Handle profile constraints (cardinality, value restrictions)
- [x] Create profile-specific identifier system
- [x] Add profile validation logic
- [x] Create unit tests with US Core examples
- [x] Update golden file tests with profile examples

## Notes
- Focus on US Core as primary example
- Ensure backward compatibility with core FHIR
- Consider complex profile scenarios (multiple inheritance)

## Completion Notes
**Completed on:** 2025-08-05

**Implementation Summary:**
- Extended TypeSchema types with profile-specific interfaces (ProfileConstraint, ProfileExtension, ProfileValidationRule)
- Enhanced profile processor to handle constraints, extensions, and validation rules
- Added profile metadata extraction including US Core specific handling
- Implemented comprehensive constraint processing (cardinality, mustSupport, bindings, types, slicing)
- Added extension processing for profile-specific extensions
- Created validation rule extraction from profile constraints
- Enhanced US Core constraint extraction with specific requirements
- Added comprehensive unit tests with US Core Patient profile examples
- Created golden file tests with US Core Patient profile validation
- All tests passing successfully

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/typeschema/types.ts` - Added profile-specific type definitions
- `src/lib/typeschema/profile/processor.ts` - Enhanced profile processing logic
- `test/typeschema/profile-generation.test.ts` - Added comprehensive profile tests
- `test/typeschema/golden.test.ts` - Added US Core Patient profile golden test
- `test/typeschema/golden/us-core-patient/` - Created golden test files
