# Task: Add Validation Capabilities

## Priority
Low

## Description
Add validation capabilities to the system:
- TypeSchema validation
- Generated code validation
- Configuration validation
- Runtime data validation (future)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement TypeSchema validation with schema definitions
- [x] Add generated code validation (syntax, TypeScript compilation)
- [x] Create validation command for CLI
- [x] Add validation to build process
- [x] Implement configuration file validation
- [x] Create validation error reporting with helpful messages
- [x] Add validation tests
- [x] Document validation rules and processes
- [ ] Consider runtime validation framework integration (zod)

## Notes
- Focus on development-time validation first
- Provide actionable error messages
- Consider performance impact of validation

## Completion Notes
Completed on 2025-08-05:
- Implemented comprehensive validation system with three main components:
  1. Configuration validation (config validate command)
  2. TypeSchema validation (typeschema validate command)
  3. Generated code validation (new module)
- Added top-level validate command that runs all validation types
- Created validation error reporting with severity levels and helpful messages
- Added comprehensive test suite with 9 passing tests
- Documented validation rules and processes in docs/validation.md
- Integrated validation commands into CLI with proper help and examples
- Supports multiple output formats (text, json) and various options (strict, verbose, selective validation)
- Runtime validation framework integration (zod) left for future enhancement
