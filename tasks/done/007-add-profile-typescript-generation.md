# Task: Add Profile-Aware TypeScript Generation

## Priority
Medium

## Description
Enhance TypeScript generator to handle profiles:
- Generate profile-specific interfaces extending base types
- Handle profile extensions in type definitions
- Organize profile types in separate namespaces
- Add profile-specific value sets

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Generate profile interfaces that extend base FHIR types
- [x] Create separate directories for profile types (resources/profiles/uscore/)
- [x] Handle profile extensions as typed properties
- [x] Generate profile-specific value set types
- [x] Add profile metadata to generated interfaces
- [x] Implement proper import/export structure for profiles
- [x] Create profile-aware Reference<T> types
- [x] Generate profile registry/index files
- [x] Add integration tests with US Core profile generation
- [x] Ensure generated profile code passes TypeScript checks

## Completion Notes
**Completed on:** 2025-08-05

**Implementation Summary:**
- Enhanced TypeScript generator with comprehensive profile support
- Added profile processing to SchemaLoader with proper categorization
- Implemented profile interface generation with inheritance from base types
- Created organized directory structure (resources/profiles/ and resources/profiles/uscore/)
- Added constraint field generation with JSDoc documentation
- Implemented extension field handling as typed properties
- Generated profile registries and metadata for runtime discovery
- Created profile-aware reference types (ProfileReference, ResourceReference, TypedProfileReference)
- Added US Core specific utilities and indexes
- Comprehensive test coverage with both unit and integration tests

**Files Modified:**
- src/generators/typescript/generator.ts - Added profile generation methods
- src/lib/generators/loader.ts - Added profile categorization
- test/integration/profile-typescript-generation.test.ts - New integration tests

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Profile interfaces extend base FHIR resources with proper TypeScript inheritance
- Constraint-based field generation with cardinality and Must Support indicators
- Extension handling with proper typing
- US Core profile detection and specialized handling
- Profile registry for runtime profile discovery
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with profile metadata

## Notes
- Maintain clean separation between core and profile types
- Consider profile versioning in generated code
- Focus on developer experience with profiles
