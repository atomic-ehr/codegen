# Task: Add Comprehensive Testing

## Priority
Medium

## Description
Implement comprehensive testing across the codebase:
- Unit tests for all library components
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Golden file testing for generated code
- CLI command testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Achieve 100% test coverage for core library components
- [ ] Create unit tests for all TypeSchema processing
- [ ] Add unit tests for all generator classes
- [ ] Implement integration tests for complete workflows
- [ ] Create golden file tests for TypeScript generation
- [ ] Add CLI command tests with various scenarios
- [ ] Create performance benchmark tests
- [ ] Add error handling tests
- [ ] Implement test data fixtures and utilities
- [ ] Set up CI/CD test automation

## Notes
- Use golden files for complex generated output testing
- Focus on edge cases and error conditions
- Consider property-based testing for complex logic
